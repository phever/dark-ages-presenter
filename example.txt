Come forth, you who are burdened — the weary, the disillusioned. You who stagger beneath the weight of your Deochs, take solace. For there is peace beyond the struggle, and Sgrios, the silent god, waits without judgment. 
He does not call to you in shouts or trumpet blasts. He does not demand or promise. He waits — still and inevitable — at the far edge of every path. To walk toward him is to walk toward truth. Not a cruel truth, but a quiet one. Not a punishment, but a release.
With death comes a beginning — but first, it marks an end. The end of suffering. The end of fear. The end of all things that torment the mind and wear down the soul. We struggle through pain and loneliness, through failure and regret, but no agony is eternal. Nothing is. That is the gift of Sgrios — the certainty that all things pass.
Even the fruit of Cail ripens, falls, and rots. Gramail’s law, etched in stone, crumbles beneath time’s hand. Glioca grants love, yet love fades and grief remains. All gifts are fleeting. All lights dim. All things end. This is not despair. This is truth. And from truth, we draw strength.
Sgrios does not scorn life — he sanctifies its conclusion. And so we do not rush to meet him. We do not worship death through surrender or waste. Instead, we live with purpose, knowing that each step brings us closer to stillness. Every breath is borrowed. Every heartbeat is a drum counting down toward silence. We are not cursed by this knowledge — we are freed by it.
Let the awareness of your end sharpen your life. Let it strip away illusion and guide your choices. When grief clutches you, remember: it will pass. When rage boils, it will cool. When despair roots deep within you, know that it, too, shall end. In all things, Sgrios is waiting — not as a thief, but as a keeper of stillness.
He is not cruel. He is not kind. He simply is. A silence so vast and patient that it embraces all things in time.
So walk on. Endure. As long as breath fills your lungs, live in his service — not by hastening your end, but by honoring its certainty. Let the knowledge of death make you humble, and let its truth make you brave. Do not walk from Death; walk toward it with clear eyes.
And when your final day arrives, do not tremble. You will not be cast aside or forgotten. You will not be judged or punished. You will simply be… complete.
Go now in silence, in stillness, in truth. Fear not the end, for it is the only thing that cannot lie. May the shadow of Sgrios walk beside you, and when the moment comes, may you return to him — not as a fugitive, but as a child coming home.
